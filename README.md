## SUMMARY:
Part A of my program stores information about university tuition, number of courses, and weeks. It then calculates the tuition per week per course taken, and the tuition per each individual class in that course. This information is stored. Part B of my program stores 6 music artists that I like listening to and then randomly chooses one, so I can decide easier what to listen to now.
